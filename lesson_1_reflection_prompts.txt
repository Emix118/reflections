How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Pointed out the diffs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Not having to rewrite or search too much for a bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    cons- you may forget to save pros-gives you more control 
 
	I think it should always have a save file of the last edit and replace it 		with the new edit if that one wasn’t saved  
		# File  —> auto save —> manual saves

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	to make sure everything in a multiple file program is working properly 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log ——stat or git diff <id of commit> <id of other commit>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
.
    Cause if you mess up, you can fix it more easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A HUGE project, it gonna be fun!!!
